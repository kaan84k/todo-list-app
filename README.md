# To-Do List App

A simple **To-Do List App** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. It also uses `localStorage` to persist tasks between page refreshes.

## Features

- ✅ Add tasks by clicking the **Add** button or pressing **Enter**.
- ✅ Mark tasks as **completed** (strikes through text).
- ✅ Delete tasks by clicking the **×** button.
- ✅ Data is stored using **localStorage** to persist tasks even after a page refresh.
- ✅ Simple, responsive UI with a clean design.
